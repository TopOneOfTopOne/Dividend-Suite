 After a stock goes ex-dividend a lot of people will try to sell and if the stock is illiquid all the buyers maybe taken up

Being late a few minutes lose arbitrage opportunity 

Stocks with margin lending are liquid and vice versa 

Margin lending 70% -> 1 share only need to pay 30% cash but if share price declines by > 5% you have to pay the decrease 

Hypothesis: On average Pex = Pcum - div*0.55 (taxing at highest tax rate)
Pex is greater following good runs in other markets

Strategy: To pick a stock if multiple dividend stocks fall on the same day choose one with the highest yield

Out of the 6 stocks (ARG,MLT,MGP,SCG,WFD,ANN) 2 lost (MLT,MGP). MGP is no surprise because it is illiquid. However MLT lost which is a surprise. It was a potential one to bet in because it had one of the highest yields. This marks potential losses using dividend stripping. The other major markets had good runs overnight, perhaps that is why the ASX had a good opening run. Perhaps the price of shares are more influenced by the US market than dividends. ANN and WFD both did not follow the above hypothesis settling at a price above the hypothesis price. ARG and SCG followed the hypothesis.

PMC first few trades followed my hypothesis but than the price crashed. This could be due to poor performance in the US market. PMC is a diversified financial and diversified financials in US market were down around 2%. CL1 had a 0.5% yield so I doubt the dividend had any bearing on the Pex price (Contradiction here, perhaps as stated on 11/02 stocks are just more influenced by US market than dividends). CL1 was positive, perhaps also due to the US market. CL1 is a software and services company and that sector was up in the US markets (~0.2%). So key take aways today my hypothesis still has legitimacy but I have to now watch each sector performance in the us market.

My previous thought that indvidual sectors of the Australian market was influenced by the individual secots of the US market was proved to be false today. There is correlation but very little. Rather I believe now the AU share market does indeed follow the US share market but as a whole and not on an individual sector basis. There was only one stock today KAM and that was illiquid with huge relative bid ask spreads. I would not have entered into this and this further proves the point that we should not enter into illiquid stocks.

US market was closed for presedential day (something like that). However the other markets were up so I expected prices to be above my hypothesis price Pex = Pcum - Div(0.15). This was true for two stocks BLD and DOW. However the concern today was that CBA fell below hypothesis price but at one point it was above hypothesis price. So this is a tricky situation, at what price should I set my limit order at? Should I always set it at hypothesis price? Right now I am thinking set limit order at 1% above hypothesis price in good market and hypothesis price in bad market.

US market closed up following good news with agreements to cut oil production. All liquid stocks reached the hypothesis price at one point or another. This is promising as it represents a good strategy with solid gains. There does appear to be momentum i.e. the price keeps rising passed the hypo price this could represent good gains but at this point I do not have enough experience so sticking to hypo price would be good for my first trade. However my results might be skewed since the US markets have been positive most the time this past few days causing prices to more likely reach hypo price. Even though the US market closed high the AU market opened lower. The Aus market did indeed close lower. This suggests there is weak correlation between Aus market and US market.

All markets were up today following cuts to oil production. All stocks with dividends were above hypo price. I may adjust my strategy than if I strongly believe the AU market will rise however my first trade will still be at hypo price since it has show reliably that regardless of a down or up AU market at some point the stock price reaches or reaches closely to hypo price.

US markets were down and so were AU markets. The dividend stock today had a very low yield > 1%. So the dividends should not have affected price much. And that was demonstrated the stock was affected more by the down US market falling to a price well below hypo price. However I would have never bought this stock regardless this reflects a pitfall. So perhaps a down market means that stocks price may fall even lower never reaching hypo price

Looking at what my strategy is, in essence if i assumed  I gained nothing from dividends and just trying to profit from franking credits I will be looking at a return of 30% minus brokerage costs. To maximise returns than I need to minimise brokerage costs so I trade infrequntly looking for highest yield stocks. But the sooner I trade the sooner I can recieve my dividends and trade again in order to recieve more franking credits. Margin lending probably will change all this

The market was down today large portion of stocks did not reach hypo price strangely enough both illiquid stocks did. For stocks that did not reach hypo price they were out by around 1.5% most were much closer. New strategy for down market open at hypo price and let it sit there for 30 mins then sell at market  

Future Focuses/Research: 
1. No difference between choosing low yield and high yield. Difference comes from being able to iterate through the cycle again faster choosing high yield. 
2. Receiving franking credits earlier 


low = Pcum/1.05
high = Pcum - div
Trading strategy:
if Pex > Pcum - div
  trade
else if Pex.between?(low,high) && trade_occured?
  trade
else 
  set_limit_sell_order(Pcum-div)
end
